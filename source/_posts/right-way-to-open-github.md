Today, I use GitHub for almost one month. The more you use, the more you get, just one word: Cool! Nice can't be hidden, just share it! Even using too short to know more, we can share it with going.

## GitHub
> Git is [Linus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)'s spare time works. 2005, when free version of BitKeeper, a commercial version control tool, timeout，how could Linux team pay for it? So Linus coded one, Git, brought version control tool directly to modernization.
> 
> Git is very high, normally is hard to learn, just like me, always use Git as SVN. But it's the right time, the power of community broke out, 2008, Ruby men talked about it in Bar, and  GitHub was born.

## Desktop
> General users, just like me, better use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Command line is cool, but it's too heavy to life.

## Pages
> Look [Hexo multi-language with Minos](/hexo-minos-multi-language/), GitHub gives you free static space to build blog or documents.
Now you can use your custom domain with https, 👍
Conscience business!

## GitBook
> This project moves on fast, and the version I saw earlier has evolved again.
You can put e-books inside and write your own api documents.

## Sub Module
> If your project uses someone's project, then you can build a pointer
> `git submodule add your_submodule_url`
> If you clone to local
> `git clone your_project_url --recursive`
> If you update
> `git submodule update`

## Private Repository
> New year, good news.
GitHub under Microsoft free the private repository to all personal users.

## Follow, Watch, Star, Fork
> Follow: like someone, follow his, catch every move
> Watch: like something, subscrible it, listen any change
> Star: praise something, encourage it, but not listen it
> Fork: clone Dolly, modify, and pull request
