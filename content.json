So in this post, I will tell you how to bring the new blog to IPFS. What is IPFSIPFS is called for short of InterPlanetary FileSystem, maybe you can visit your data from another galaxy. Due to the limit speed of light, we need quantum entanglement communication to play well. dengcbWelcome to my GitHub IPFS uses data hash address instead of website domain, but in the next, you will find if you want to visit your data in IPFS within a traditional website, you still need domain. And to get hash data, you have to visit a IPFS node server. So, want to decentralize, you maybe need a centralized server first. Meanwhile, distributed data storage will cause waste. Some updated files, previous versions are no longer valid, but are pinned and permanently retained inside IPFS and cannot be deleted. Even the owner has forgotten the previous data hash, the dead files become ghosts in the IPFS system.

The actual feeling, is different from we thought before. The first open takes a long time, always 504 timeout, but once connection is success, open will be very quick. Why? The IPFS official admits this is caused by the IPNS service bugs. We published name in the past, so we don’t need modify DNS while change files. However, ipns service is very time-consuming and takes more than 1 minute often. Meanwhile, ipfs is almost seconds. IPFS Officle website content is fixed, so hash address doesn’t change, using ipfs and open fast. If, IPFS cannot enhance the speed of ipns service, first open needs ONE minute always, who can wait?","link":"/bring-you-to-ipfs/"},{"title":"Hello, world!","text":"Let’s begin~","link":"/hello-world/"},{"title":"Hexo multi-language with Minos","text":"I want to build a hexo blog with full site multi-language, search a lot and try, but no one perfect. Today it’s done, finally I can white down a tutorial for your reference. What I seek Full Site Multi-language Choose English as the default language, and translate full site into your native language, all items one to one correspondence. dengcbWelcome to my GitHub Why use Minos Hexo hasn’t multi-language kernel, though you can install official i18n plugin, but only get some translated shell, all the content in different languages still mix together. Minos is a simple and powerful theme, and support the multi-language thoroughly with lastest release. How I tryPassing Pit Official i18n PluginSet i18n_dir: :lang in _config.yml, you can generate an i18n slug, just that. All multilingual posts still mix. Note: the setting also needs in Minos. hexo-generator-i18nThis plugin can get multilingual pages, but not posts or tags, because hexo kernel doesn’t support. hexo-multilingual and its generatorThis is a real plugin that changes the kernel, you should uninstall all official generators first. But the author is too busy to fix some issues. And this plugin always start ‘en’ in default slug. Other TricksSuch as build two sites and different route; or rewrite the core code. I think it’s not what I want, drop it. Meeting MinosView a lot of themes, choose Minos at last, not the popular next theme. Because I want the classical website to be less colorful, less drawing, just words or ascii codes. So Minos wins. I hope more hexor can choose Minos like me. When using Minos at first, it doesn’t support multi-language yet. Its 1.0 version has been released more than 2 years. Author just want to update to 2.0, and plan to support i18n fully. I test this days and feedback some issues, the latest release finally achieve the full site multi-language support today (post、page、archive、category、tag、search、switcher etc.). Now I can tell you how I build site with Minos. Convention best What we needIs variety needs, or simple to use. If former, the full site multi-language still needs time, Minos is not the silver bullet. If later, congratulations, you can do it today with least configurations. Such as, you set config to: permalink: :category/:title/, then slug as: /nothing/zh-cn/hello-world/, that’s the conflict between convention and configuration.

The more you use, the more you get, just one word: Cool! Nice can’t be hidden, just share it! Even using too short to know more, we can share it with going. GitHub Git is Linus‘s spare time works. 2005, when free version of BitKeeper, a commercial version control tool, timeout，how could Linux team pay for it? So Linus coded one, Git, brought version control tool directly to modernization. Git is very high, normally is hard to learn, just like me, always use Git as SVN. But it’s the right time, the power of community broke out, 2008, Ruby men talked about it in Bar, and GitHub was born. Desktop General users, just like me, better use GitHub Desktop.
